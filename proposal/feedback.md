## Feedback
You picked a well scoped task and the dataset you chose fits it nicely. One thing I noticed is that the ML section feels a bit on the light side. Your evaluation plan is good, although you might want to say a bit about how you will deal with classes that are very rare, since 13 OS labels can be uneven (like in many datasets, if this problem exits). Also if your goal wants to go beyond just replication, some appropriate model hyperparameter fine-tuning may be in order. Other than these small points, the project seems very doable and well aligned with the class goals.
